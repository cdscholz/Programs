        /* What is abstraction?
        Abstraction: In Java process of hiding the implementation of details of a class
                     and exposing only the essential features and behaviors that are
                     relevant to the user

        How is abstraction achieved in Java?

        Abstract Classes:
                    - Can't be instantiated
                    - Declared using keyword "abstract"
                    - At least one or more abstract methods within the class
                    - Can only be used as a base/parent/super class
        Abstract Methods:
                    - Used in abstract classes(or interface, depending on the programming language)
                    - Declared using keyword "abstract"
                    - Implemented in the derived/child/sub (concrete --> non-abstract) classes
                    - Can NOT be implemented within the abstract class

        When do we use abstract methods?
                    - We use them when you know all derived/sub/child classes should have the method
                    - How you implement it will depend on the derived/sub/child class
